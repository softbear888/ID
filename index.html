  <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
  <h2>An exploration into iteration and user testing.</h2>

  <!-- content -->
  <p>The process of creating a satisfactory design is often a complex one. At a high level, designers create sketches,
    lofi wireframes, hifi prototypes, and at last a final product. Laid out this way, the process doesn’t seem so bad.
    But with each version comes multiple rounds - iterations - of work. Changes both big and small are fueled by
    feedback from the design team itself and outside users. It is this iteration that is core to design, driving it
    toward a product that is well-tested, well-designed, and well-received. In this project, we sought to familiarize
    ourselves with iterative design by creating an interactive mockup based on an active startup idea.</p>
  <p>Ole is a shopping service that allows users to order online without worrying about whether clothes will fit or look
    good on them. Users input their zip code and view clothing items from various stores in the area. Thus, the clothes
    are not limited by brand or store. A personal shopper picks up the items and delivers them at a time that is determined by the user at checkout. While the driver waits, the user can try on each clothing item and select
    which ones to return or keep. The items they wish to return are given back to the driver, who completes the return
    process on the user’s behalf.</p>
  <p>Because of the delivery-based nature of the service, we decided to design for a desktop view. We imagine that most
    users will be on their computers when in the comfort of their own homes (or generally indoors), and thus would
    access Ole through those devices.</p>

  <h3>Part I - Sketching & Wireframing</h3>
  <h4>Sketches</h4>

  <!-- sample style: a group of 4 images -->
  <p>We began the process by creating quick sketches of the core pages. The goal here was to explore a breadth of ideas.</p>
  <div id="image_box">
    <div class="grace-sketches">
      <p><b>Set #1:</b> Left: Sketches showing concepts for core pages: Home, Shopping, Location/Time Selection, and
        Cart. The Inspiration page was something we thought might be helpful for users: a way to view pre-existing
        outfits and gain inspiration for one's own style.</p>
      <p>Right: Additional sketches for the Inspiration page, which we considered a more unique page.</p>
      <img src="source/Grace-Sketches.JPG" alt="image' - front" width=50%>
      <img src="source/Grace-Sketches-2.JPG" alt="image' - back" width=49%>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="image_box">
    <div class="katherine-sketches">
      <p><b>Set #2:</b> Sketches show the general layout of the Home page, Shopping page, and Cart page.</p>
      <img src="source/Katherine-Sketches-1.png" alt="image' - front" width=33%>
      <img src="source/Katherine-Sketches-2.png" alt="image' - front" width=33%>
      <img src="source/Katherine-Sketches-3.png" alt="image' - front" width=33%>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="image_box">
    <p><b>Set #3:</b> Sketches of each page & user's thoughts. Users of Ole typically want to shop for new clothes but find
      in-person shopping tiring.</p>
    <img src="source/Eileen_sketch.png" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
  </div>
  <div id="image_box">
    <p><b>Set #4:</b> Sketches of potential Shopping, Return, and Shipping Confirmation pages.</p>
    <img src="source/TOMMY-SKETCH-1.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
    <img src="source/TOMMY-SKETCH-2.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
    <img src="source/TOMMY-SKETCH-3.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
  </div>

  <h4>Wireframes</h4>
  <p>After reviewing our sketches, we refined our ideas into lofi wireframes. Core design decisions and/or functionalities are noted beneath each wireframe.</p>
  <!-- 12 screens of lofi wireframes. Please replace the images! -->
  <div id="image_box">
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Home.JPG" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
      <p>A homepage consisting of a welcome message and a brief description of the service. Users can enter their zip
        code to see which stores/clothing items are available nearby. A map at the bottom of the page updates when the
        user enters a valid zip code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Cart.JPG" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>A page displaying all the items a user has added to their cart. Basic information about each item (price, quantity, subtotal, size, and color) is displayed. A breakdown of the costs is shown to the right.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Checkout.JPG" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
      <p>A page that allows users to input their information for the order. The Order Summary box still appears to
        remind users of what is generally in their order. They can return to the Cart page if they need more details, or
        would like to edit their order. In a fully developed application, there would be a very similar page for billing
        information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Return.JPG" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>This is where users can choose which items to keep and which items to return. It is very similar to the Cart
        page, but has checkboxes in lieu of the trash can icon. Checking the box associated with an item updates the
        Return Summary box.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Inspiration.JPG" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
      <p>A Pinterest-style page that allows users to scroll through various outfits. If they find an outfit they like,
        they can click on it to view the items in the outfit and/or "heart" it. There is also a scrollable side section
        with suggested outfits based on the user's past likes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Inspiration-2.JPG" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>If a user clicks on an outfit, they are shown an enlarged image of the outfit, alongside the items in the
        outfit. We debated having an "Add to Cart" button next to each item, but decided against it. To add an item to
        cart, one would have to provide a size, color, and quantity, as well as be aware of the price. This was more
        information than we thought would be wise to display. We decided it would be best to separate this functionality
        and simply allow the user to navigate to an item's page by clicking on the image of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Order-Confirmation.JPG" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
      <p>A simple order confirmation screen that lets the user know their purchase was successful. The button in the
        middle of the screen takes the user to the next step in the process: choosing which items to return and accept.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Shipping Confirmation Page.png" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>A page where people can choose what time they want their personal shopper to arrive with their items, as well as which shipping method they prefer. A map displays the address that the user previously inputted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Item_Page_Updated.png" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>The page for each item, where items' details are displayed and can be customized.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wireframe-box">
      <img src="source/Return-Confirmation.JPG" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
      <p>A simple confirmation screen that lets the user know their transaction was successful. The button in the middle
        of the screen takes the user back to the Shop page in case they want to follow up on their order.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Part II - Mockups</h3>
  <h4>Preview of Prototype</h4>
  <p>Below is a preview of our hifi prototype, created based on our lofi wireframes and the feedback we received during a critique session with peers.</p>
  <div id="image_box">
    <img src="source/prototype.png" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
  </div>
  <h4>Critique Feedback</h4>
  <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5>Overall & Miscellaneous</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the same padding and margin across all pages. The buttons involved in the checkout process appear to
            be in slightly different positions on different pages.</li>
          <li>Keep the rounding of boxes and images consistent.</li>
          <li>The navigation bar is not fully functional on all pages. Fixing this will help emulate the actual
            experience of using the site more accurately.</li>
          <li>The navigation bar in particular is a bit "jumpy" between pages.</li>
          <li>A wishlist page might be helpful as a way to store liked items.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Browsing (Shopping) Page</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Placing filters at the top or left feels more intuitive.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Item Page</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a description for each item.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Checkout Page</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Users cannot go back to the previous page while checking out, which is commonly supported and expected
            functionality.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Shipping/Time Confirmation Page</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider offering ranges instead of specific times.</li>
          <li>Strengthen the hierarchy. At the moment, numerous elements appear to be at the same level of hierarchy
            when it seems like there should be an order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Order Confirmation Page</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Show a summary of the items that were ordered.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="image_box">
    <p>Because we received numerous critiques about consistency, we sought to strengthen our style guide, which can be
      found below:</p>
    <img width=100% src="source/Style-Guide.JPG" />
  </div>
  <div class="list">
    <p>Based on other feedback from critique, we improved our prototype in several ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Added the ability to go back to previous steps in the checkout process.
      <li>Standardized rounding and positioning of elements. In particular, the Summary sections and checkout-related
        buttons are now all positioned in the same location.
      <li>The navbar is functional on all pages.
      <li>Added a wishlist page.
      <li>Altered the location of the filters on the Browse page.
      <li>Added a description for each clothing item.
      <li>Redesigned the Shipping/Time Confirmation page so that it has a clearer, more intuitive hierarchy. In
        particular, text sizes are more clearly different. The page also offers time ranges instead of concrete times.
    </ul>

  <h3>Part III - User Testing</h3>
  <p>To iterate further, we had three professional user testers assess our prototype. The task that we provided and the accompanying feedback appear below.
  <h4>User testing tasks</h4>
  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  <p>Imagine you are a shopper looking to use Ole to pick out a blue sweater for
    the winter months. You already added a couple of items to the cart earlier today and are just looking to add
    one more item. Please think out loud as you navigate the prototype from page to page. Please note that the
    screens are not interactive; this interface is an interactive mockup made on prototyping software. This
    means, for example, the buttons with links will take you from webpage to webpage but will not alter the
    contents of the page you are on (e.g. if you click &lsquo;like&rsquo; on a clothing item the heart will not
    change color). We are seeking feedback on the interaction, navigation, hierarchy, and intended
    functionality.</p>
  <h5>Subtasks</h5>

  <div class="list">
  <ol>
    <li>Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial
      impressions of the website? Explain your answer.</li>
    <li>Browse the page and look for a blue sweater. Add it to your
      cart. [5-point rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
    <li>From the cart page, access the &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo; page
      from the navigation bar. Click the image with the blue sweater to explore potential outfits you can pair
      the clothes with. Describe your thoughts on the interfaces as you go. Is it easy to navigate? How does
      it compare to services like Pinterest? [5-point rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
    <li>Go back to the cart. Purchase all of the items that are in
      the cart (the other ones are there from a previous visit you had to this page in this scenario). Go as
      far as you can until you get to the confirmation page. Move on to the next task when you&#39;re done.
      [5-point rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
    <li>After reaching the confirmation page, return the coat.
      [5-point rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
    <li>What 3 words would you use to describe Ole&#39;s webpage?
      Explain your answer.</li>
    <li>Any overall comments about the interface? Were there any
      places where you felt confused?</li>
  </ol>
</div>

  </div>

  <h4>Summary of Results &mdash; Sorted By Theme</h4>
  <div class="list">
  <h5>Navigation </h5>
  <p>1. Tester Feedback
  <ul>
    <li>Users enjoyed how most pages in the
      checkout process showed what they ordered and thought checkout was fluid.</li>
    <li>Two users navigated directly to the
      Cart page instead of first looking at the Browse page.</li>
    <li>One user assumed<span>&nbsp;that by clicking 'Submit', they would be sent to a final confirmation page before their order was placed. Maybe rename
        &lsquo;Place Order&rsquo;.</li>
    <li>Users were often confused about whether an item was added to the
      cart.</li>
    <li>Enjoyed Shopping page but wanted a number next to the cart icon indicating how many items they had added and wanted a popup
      stating that the website was successfully updated.</li>
  </ul>
  2. Potential Interface Changes
  <ul>
    <li>Rename the &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; button to &lsquo;Place
      Order&rsquo; so the user is more aware of what pressing the button does.</li>
    <li>Confirmation message appears at top of screen when item is added
      to cart and cart has number of items displayed as an icon.</li>
    <li>Remove the navigation bar from the home page so that users know
      that they are supposed to enter their zip code to enter rather than jump to other pages first.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Hierarchy</h5>
  <p>1. Tester Feedback
  <ul>
    <li>Confused about the keep/return functionality on the Return page.</li>
    <li>Users wanted more ways to sort (e.g. by color) so that they could
      find
      the
      blue sweater quicker.</li>
    <li>Confused about how to select times on the Shipping
      Confirmation
      page but liked that they could pick when the item would be delivered.</li>
  </ul>
 2. Potential Interface Changes
  <ul>
    <li>Make the buttons on the Shipping Confirmation page look more similar to
      other buttons on the website and have more affordances (e.g. darken when hovering) so that
      people
      know
      they can push them.</li>
    <li>Remove the keep button on the Return page so that people
      aren&rsquo;t confused by that functionality. Consider replacing the keep/return buttons with simple checkboxes.</li>
    <li>Add filters.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Functionality</h5>
  <p>1. Tester Feedback
  <ul>
    <li>Thought website was a base prototype for shopping companies
      based on home page.</li>
    <li>Liked the front page but didn&rsquo;t like the word frictionless<span class="c1">&nbsp;&mdash;
        liked
        how
        it
        gave an introduction to the website.</li>
    <li>Wish the page didn&rsquo;t make you select options in order on the
      return page. The process was easy once that requirement was made clear.</li>
  </ul>
 2. Potential Interface Changes
  <ul>
    <li>Make the Return page operate so you do not have to choose which
      items to keep/return in sequential order. (This was our intent, but we were unable to capture the full functionality in Figma.)</li>
    <li>Make it more clear on the homepage what the purpose of the
      startup is.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Conclusions & Takeaways</h3>
  <div class="list">
  <ul>
    <li>Consistency goes a long way in a design. Inconsistencies with styling and placement can draw users' attention away from the content itself.
    <li>Different users may feel differently about the same aspect of a design. Sometimes, there is no clear-cut answer, and it is up to the designers to make the final call.
    <li>Getting attached to a particular design is not the answer. Even after iterating, users may have critiques about parts of the design that the development team thought were intuitive. Designers must be willing to listen and adapt.
  </ul>
